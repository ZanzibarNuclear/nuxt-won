# Expectations

> The surest path to disappointment is to have expectations.

No, I don't mean it. That's way too cynical.

Regardless, let's make sure you understand what World of Nuclear is all about.

- This is a place to learn about nuclear energy and the ways we can use it to benefit humanity.
  - We will talk about nuclear science, our best understanding of how nuclear energy is released, and the byproducts of fission and fusion.
  - We will talk about nuclear power: the many ways to turn nuclear energy into electricity.
  - We will explore how nuclear energy is used to fight cancer.
  - We will talk about nuclear waste and how it can be reprocessed and reused.
- This is a place to express beliefs and opinions.
  - No one has all of the right answers. Some ideas are more right than others.
  - We will have open discussions about myths and misunderstandings.
  - We can be optimistic about the possibilities and realistic about the challenges.
  - Some interest groups have been "effective" at spreading bad news about nuclear, even when their "information" is based on speculation and wildly out of date. We will counteract the damage through positive, informative discussions.
- This is a place to be curious and to expand your mind.
  - What you learn might lead to employment opprotunities.
  - You might be able to impact the future and help humanity thrive.
  - Perhaps you will gain the knowledge and persuasive arguments needed to help others see the benefits of nuclear and to stop being scared of it.

## What You Won't Find

- This is not a place to dwell on destructive uses of nuclear energy.
  - The development of nuclear bombs played an important historical role in the rapid advancement of nuclear science and engineering.
  - Plenty has been written about that, and it's better to spend time imagining how to be more productive with nuclear energy.
