# Why Nuclear Energy?

## Incremental Optimization

Energy is the key to thriving. As living beings, we have built-in systems for converting food into energy. While we can optimize that conversion by adjusting our diet, through proper breathing, and by exercising our muscles, there is a limit to how much energy our bodies can use.

To do more than merely survive, we direct natural energy sources toward outcomes we desire. For example, we might use a lens to focus sunlight (radiation energy) onto a dry leaf to start a fire. We then add some wood and use the fire (an exothermic chemical reaction) to boil water to cook our food. We eat the food, and our bodies extract more energy than if we had eaten the food raw.

Given the limits of our bodies, there is a corresponding limit to the amount of physical labor we can do. To do more, we need machines that draw from different energy sources. One such source is potential energy. Using a water wheel, people have taken advantage of the gravitational pull of water to grind wheat into flour, which is a key ingredient in bread. Again, we found an improvement in terms of acquiring useful calories.

Then we improved on the water wheel. We dammed rivers and introduced water turbines used to generate electricity. Electricity is easy to transport using a bit of high-gauge wire. From gravity to electrons that power our toasters to make our bread that much tastier.

In a relative blink on the galactic timeline, humans have devised many ways to convert natural energy to productive uses. Let's take a quick review of energy sources.

## Practical Energy Sources

Some sources of energy are practical in the sense that we know how to use them. They work in practice.

For this discussion, we can set aside secondary concerns, like the potential for fire to burn down your neighborhood. "What if" scenarios tend to introduce fear-based thinking. Rather than being distracted looking for tigers in the jungle, stay calm and keep a dispassionate mindset about fundamentals.

### Burning Things (Combustion)

Oxygen and a spark are all that is needed to light fuel ablaze, releasing energy in the form of heat and light. Burning is a self-sustaining chemical reaction. As long as there is fuel and oxygen, the reaction will continue, and its heat energy can be put to work.

The common outcome of burning things is the production of carbon dioxide and water, which are both useful. The drawback is the release of pollutants into the air: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particles of carbon. In terms of minimizing pollution, burning hydrogen is the best we can do.

Fossil fuels are a rich source of energy, which is why they are so popular. Burning them releases lots of pollution, which is why we want to switch to something better. Among fossil fuels, natural gas can burn rather cleanly, making it one of the better options in that regard.

### Harvesting the Weather

Wind power

### Harvesting Sunlight

Focusing rays

Moving electrons in photovoltaic cells

### Harvesting Gravity

Dams

Wave power

### Tapping Into the Earth's Core

Heat from the core is a result of the pressure of gravity and radiation from nuclear decay. Geysers show us how that heat energy can be transformed into kinetic energy, released in a periodic spray of water.

### The Combo Platter

Biomass - combines sunlight with combustion

### Splitting Atoms (Fission)

## Theoretical Energy Sources

Some sources of energy are theoretical. They are based on our ideas of how things work, but we have not yet figured out a reliable way to put these ideas to work.

While there is nothing wrong with seeking new and better ways of converting energy, they cannot be put to practical use.

### Combining Atoms (Fusion)

Mimicing the sun seems like the most efficient way to release energy. While experiments have proven that this is possible, it is not yet practical. Until we can create a sustained fusion reaction that we can control, fusion remains on the list of theoretical energy sources.

### Quantum Energy

## Why Nuclear Energy Is Better

Given all of the options we have for extracting energy, what makes nuclear the best energy source? The rest of this course is dedicated to answering that question.
