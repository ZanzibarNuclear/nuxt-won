Do you know the old joke? How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.

That is also a great approach to learning about nuclear energy. To get a solid understanding of nuclear requires knowledge in many different areas. Packing that knowledge into your brain takes effort and time.

To make it easier, we break down what you need to know into bite-sized lessons. Each lesson explains a single concept and should take about 10 minutes to complete. The lessons are grouped into courses that focus on a particular aspect of nuclear energy.

Easy enough.

Along the way, we will give you a chance to test yourself, to see what you have learned. As you complete your study, we will give you little rewards that mark your progress.

Here are the courses. Start at the beginning, and we will guide you from one lesson to the next.
