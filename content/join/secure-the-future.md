# Powering Our Future: Preserving and Advancing Nuclear Energy

Join us in supporting a critical mission: maintaining our existing nuclear fleet while paving the way for the next generation of advanced reactors. Our platform is dedicated to ensuring a smooth transition from the reliable nuclear power of today to the cutting-edge nuclear technology of tomorrow.

## The Dual Challenge: Preserve and Progress

We face a pivotal moment in our energy landscape:

1. **Preserving Existing Nuclear Power**:
   - **Climate Imperative**: Our current nuclear fleet is a cornerstone of clean energy production, providing over 50% of America's carbon-free electricity.
   - **Grid Stability**: Nuclear plants provide reliable baseload power, essential for maintaining a stable electric grid.
   - **Economic Impact**: Nuclear plants are often economic anchors in their communities, providing high-paying jobs and substantial tax revenue.

2. **Transitioning to Advanced Nuclear Technology**:
   - **Efficiency Gains**: New reactor designs offer improved fuel efficiency and reduced waste production.
   - **Enhanced Safety**: Advanced reactors incorporate passive safety features and fail-safe designs.
   - **Flexible Operation**: Modern reactors can better complement renewable energy sources by adjusting output as needed.
   - **Reduced Costs**: Standardized designs and modular construction promise to lower construction and operational costs.

## Why This Matters

- **Climate Goals**: Maintaining and expanding nuclear capacity is crucial for meeting ambitious decarbonization targets.
- **Energy Security**: A robust nuclear sector enhances national energy independence.
- **Innovation Leadership**: Investing in new nuclear technology positions us at the forefront of global energy innovation.
- **Workforce Development**: This transition creates opportunities for a new generation of nuclear engineers and technicians.
- **Economic Growth**: The nuclear industry supports hundreds of thousands of high-skill jobs across the country.
