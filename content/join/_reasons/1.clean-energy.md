## Why Nuclear Energy Matters

- **Clean Power**: Nuclear energy does not release greenhouse gases, making it an ideal fuel for power plants in the fight against climate change.
- **Reliable Base Load**: Nuclear plants can provide consistent power 24/7. Nuclear is ready to go anytime and all of the time. That means it can take over when "renewable" sources of energy are not working. Solar can only work in sunlight. Wind only works when it windy enough but not too windy.
- **Energy Independence**: We have lots of good uses for gas and oil. We don't have to burn them to generate electricity. Conserving fossil fuels means we will have plenty for the long run, while we rely on nuclear energy to power our lifestyles.
- **Advanced Applications**: Beyond electricity, nuclear technology has applications in medicine, space exploration, and industrial processes.
